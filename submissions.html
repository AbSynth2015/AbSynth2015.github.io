		  <h1>Call For Papers</h1>
		  <p>We invite contributions on the use of formal methods and model driven software engineering for robotics applicatons.</p>
		  
		<p style="text-align:justify">Submissions should not exceed 6 pages (full papers), 3 pages (short papers) formatted according to the IEEE conference paper guidelines, and should be submitted as Portable Document Format (PDF) files using the Easychair submission site: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fmmdse2015" style="color: rgb(0,255,0);text-decoration: none"><font color="FF00CC"> https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fmmdse2015</font></a> . Contributions will be reviewed for quality and relevance to the workshop's theme. Submission of preliminary results would also be considered.</p>	
			<p></p>
			<p style="text-align:justify">Authors of the accepted papers will be asked to submit their camera-ready version along with a poster. All accepted papers will be presented during the poster session. A subset of the selected accepted papers will be invited for a 15 minute oral presentation.</p>
<p></p>
		  <p style="text-align:justify">To foster dialogue and collaboration between researchers, this workshop will be designed to be as interactive as possible, with organized discussions and informal breakout sessions across both days.  As such, a large part of this effort is to bring together a community of robotic researchers who are working in the area of formal methods and MDSE. Ample time will be provided for networking and informal discussions.</p>
