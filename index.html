			<h1>Home</h1>
			This two-day workshop is to be held within <a href="https://www.roboticsconference.org/" style="color: rgb(0,255,0);text-decoration: none"><font color="FF00CC"> Robotics, Science and Systems Conference-2015</font></a> with regard to Formal Methods (FM) and Model-Driven Software Engineering (MDSE). It has broadly three aims: presenting state-of-the-art tools and techniques in both fields especially with respect to robotics, fostering closer collaboration between researchers of these fields and finally indentifying the challenges that lie ahead in not only briding the gap but also their application in robotics.

			<h1>Description</h1>
			The increasing use of automation in safety- and mission-critical situations encourages the development of
theories and techniques that can provide formal guarantees on the performance of the system. Model-Driven
Software Engineering (MDSE) and Formal Methods (FM) are closely related in the sense that they both seek
abstractions that preserve the important properties of the underlying concrete system, as well as provide
rigorous methods for system design to ensure desirable behavior with respect to complex specifications.

			In MDSE, once a suitable model or equivalent specification is found, a correct-by-design code is assumed
to be generated using model transformations. On the other hand, FM, originally developed to support
software verification and design, provide a basis for synthesis of such provably correct programs. Much like
the divergence of classical AI and robotics into separate fields concerned with high-level and low-level details
of the same system (robots), FM and MDSE have diverged. MDSE research in robotics should be more
aligned with the primary goal of creating quality software for robotic systems at low level. Formal methods
in control and robotics are applied to the design and validation of systems at the high-level of abstraction.
In addition, MDSE can promote FM adoption by increasing the abstraction level and by providing tools for
formal verification.
			<p></p>
			<h2>Formal Methods</h2>
			Formal Methods refers broadly to a set of tools and techniques for automatic, principled synthesis and verifi-
cation of systems that satisfy well-specified properties. They provide a rich class of logics to describe complex
tasks and theoretically sound methods for ensuring provably correct behavior for autonomous robotic sys-
tems. Such systems and applications, however, pose unique challenges for formal verification and synthesis.
The hybrid, real-time natures of robotic systems motivates the development of logic languages and synthesis
methods for real-time systems. The complex dynamics of robotic systems and multi-robot systems prompt
the extension of hierarchical and compositional synthesis in FM to large-scale robotic systems. Other factors
that need to be addressed in employing FM for control design include, but are not limited to, the incom-
pleteness and uncertainty in robot's sensing and actuation modularities, as well as partial knowledge in the
dynamics of the system and its environment.
			<p></p>
			<h2>Need for reunification</h2>
			Currently, MDSE and Formal Methods are progressing as two different axes of research in robotics. MDSE
concentrates more on metamodeling, separations of concerns, model transformations, and code generation,
while FM focuses more at the high-level specification and reasoning that result in provably correct robotic
systems. However, a reunification is needed: quality, reliable software for robotic systems created using
MDSE will facilitate the abstraction and modeling of robotic systems, which further promotes the adoption
of FM in constructing robotic systems with a high degree of autonomy.
			<p></p>
			<h2>Goals</h2>
			This workshop aims to advance the research and development of theory, tools and applications of FM and
MDSE to robotics and automation. To this end, the concrete goals of this workshop, are three-fold:
			<ul class="d">			
			<li>Presenting new theories and tools in FM and MDSE, which can be readily used in the control and
verification of robotic systems.</li>
			<li>Fostering dialogue and collaboration between researchers in these two communities.</li>
			<li>Proposing challenging and important research questions about the integration of FM with MDSE, and
their application to robotic systems.</li>
			</ul>

			<h1>Submission</h1>
			Submissions should not exceed 6 pages (full papers), 3 pages (short papers) formatted according to the IEEE conference paper guidelines, and should be submitted as Portable Document Format (PDF) files using the Easychair submission site: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fmmdse2015" style="color: rgb(0,255,0);text-decoration: none"><font color="FF00CC"> https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fmmdse2015</font></a> . Contributions will be reviewed for quality and relevance to the workshop's theme. Submission of preliminary results would also be considered.	
			<p></p>
			Authors of the accepted papers will be asked to submit their camera-ready version along with a poster. All accepted papers will be presented during the poster session. A subset of the selected accepted papers will be invited for a 15 minute oral presentation.
<p></p>
To foster dialogue and collaboration between researchers, this workshop will be designed to be as interactive
as possible, with organized discussions and informal breakout sessions across both days.  As such, a large part of this effort is to bring together a community of robotic researchers who are working in the area of formal methods and MDSE. Ample time will be provided for networking and informal discussions.
