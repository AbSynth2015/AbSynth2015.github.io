<p>Title:  Formal Synthesis of Control Strategies for Dynamical Systems</p>
<abs>Abstract:

In control theory, complex models of physical processes, such as systems of differential equations, are usually checked against simple specifications, such as stability and set invariance. In formal methods, rich specifications, such as languages and formulae of temporal logics, are checked against simple models of software programs and digital circuits, such as finite transition graphs. With the development and integration of cyber physical and safety critical systems, there is an increasing need for computational tools for verification and control of complex systems from rich, temporal logic specifications.

The formal verification and synthesis problems have been shown to be undecidable even for very simple classes of infinite-space continuous and hybrid systems. However, provably correct but conservative approaches, in which the satisfaction of a property by a dynamical system is implied by the satisfaction of the property by a finite over-approximation (abstraction) of the system, have received a lot of attention in recent years. The focus of this talk is on synthesis. It is first shown that game-based control strategies for finite systems can be adapted to produce conservative approaches to control of continuous-time and discrete-time dynamical systems. It is then shown then refinement and Lyapunov-based techniques can be used to reduce the conservatism. The usefulness of these computational tools is illustrated with various examples. </abs>

			<p>Title: Model-Driven Engineering for Robotic Software Product Lines </p>

The cost of creating new robotics products is significantly related to the complexity of developing software
control systems that are 
flexible enough to easily accommodate
frequently changing requirements: more advanced tasks
in highly dynamic environments, in collaboration with unskilled
users, and in compliance with changing regulations.

In various application domains software product line (SPL)
development has proven to be the most eective approach
to face this kind of challenges. A SPL is a set of software intensive
systems that share a common set of features for
satisfying a particular market segment's needs. Each new
application is built from the SPL repository of common software
assets (e.g. architectural models, software components).

Typically, a SPL is a strategic investment for organizations,
which wants to achieve customer value through large commercial
diversity of their proucts with a minimum of technical
diversity at minimal cost. 

The talk will illustrate our experience in developing
MDE tools for modeling and configuring robotic SPL. </abs>

<p>Title:
A Greedy Approach for the Efficient Repair of Stochastic Controller Models</p>
<abs>Abstract:
<img src="images/abraham.jpg" alt="Calin Belta" style="margin:0px 10px" height="150px"  width="100px" align="left">
Probabilistic modelling languages are popular formalisms to model systems with randomized components in their behaviour. Probabilistic models play an important role also in robotics, for example when modelling controllers.

A great advantage of formal models is that they allow the application of formal methods for their analysis. For discrete-time probabilistic models there are efficient methods to check whether they satisfy certain properties. If a property is refuted, available techniques can be used to explain the failure in form of a counterexample.

However, there are no scalable approaches to repair a model, i.e., to modify it with respect to certain side conditions such that the property is satisfied. In this talk we discuss such a method, which avoids expensive computations and is therefore applicable to large models.</abs>

<p>Title:  Efficient Parameter Synthesis in Probabilistic Models</p>
<abs>Abstract: 
<img src="images/katoen.jpg" alt="Calin Belta" style="margin:0px 10px" height="150px"  width="100px" align="left">
We present several techniques for analyzing parametric Markov chains (pMCs), chains in which the transitions are labeled with polynomials over in the set of model variables.  The core is to compute a rational function (i.e., a fraction of two polynomials in the model parameters) for reachability and expected reward objectives.

Our technique outperforms state-of-the-art tools and supports computing conditional probabilities over pMCs.  This is supplemented by support for incremental automatic parameter synthesis (using SMT techniques) to determine "safe" and "unsafe" regions of the parameter space. All values in these regions give rise to instantiated MCs satisfying or violating the (conditional) probability or expected reward objective.

Experimental results show that our techniques scale to MCs with millions of states and several parameters.

The techniques are supported by the web-based PROPhESY tool supporting visualization and user-guided parameter synthesis.</abs>
